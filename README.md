## Abstract
The core goal of this project is to migrate MRI microstructure mapping technology from the MATLAB platform to the Python platform, creating a robust, open-source, and user-friendly package to improve the broad availability and utility of the technology.

Python was chosen as the target platform because of its wide range of applications, rich library support, and good community activity, making it an ideal choice for scientific research and application development. Through this project, we have successfully transformed InSpect technology from MATLAB to Python, which is a good fit for InSpect technology. Using Python to implement machine science instead of the traditional optimization method used in MATLAB not only optimizes the operation efficiency of the algorithm but also enhances its application flexibility in the field of medical image processing.

In addition, the open-source nature allows researchers worldwide to freely use and modify the software package, further driving innovation and development of medical imaging technology.
